This is an example of how I code in android and is my first project using Firebase.

Firebase Code Sample Idea:
Reminder app that connects two people to remind each other expect one person is secretly an AI.
You tell the app to remind you of something then it “connects” you to the AI and the AI tells you to remind it of something and you have to buzz it with a button to remind it of something and if you forget to remind it then it will disconnect from you and it will be harder to find another person in the future since your reliability rating has gone down. 
The point of it being an AI is to trick you into thinking it is a person and tick you into checking the app because you feel like someone is depending on you and by checking the app it reminds you of what you requested to be reminded about anyways. However since it isn’t a real person you won’t get sketchy reminders and the AI can manipulate you into remembering your own reminders by changing it’s reminder request.

The initial process will be focusing on creating a basic android app to interface with firebase however once that is complete I will also create a web app using polymer as a fun side project to help familiarize myself more with firebase.
